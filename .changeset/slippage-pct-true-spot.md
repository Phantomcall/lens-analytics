Fix `slippagePct` on `/price/:a/:b/route`, which was always exactly 0 because
the execution price was compared with itself. It is now the shortfall of the
execution price against the AMM reserve-ratio spot price, so it grows with
order size against a fixed pool. Route selection and `estimatedOutput` are
unchanged. Slippage is only reported for an AMM route; SDEX and SPLIT routes
(and pairs with no AMM pool) have no size-independent spot reference, so the
value stays 0 rather than reporting a cross-venue spread as slippage.
