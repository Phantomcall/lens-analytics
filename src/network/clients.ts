/**
 * Per-network Horizon / Soroban RPC client factories.
 *
 * Every ingester and aggregator that talks to a Stellar network needs a
 * Horizon.Server or SorobanRpc.Server bound to that network's endpoints.
 * Previously these were created once as module-level singletons bound to
 * whatever network was active at import time, which made it impossible to
 * run ingesters against more than one network in the same process.
 *
 * getHorizonServer(network) / getRpcServer(network) return a client cached
 * per network so repeated calls for the same network reuse one instance,
 * while different networks always resolve to distinct clients.
