// being worse than a merge, because `last_trade_timestamp.set()` is a
// last-writer-wins overwrite rather than an additive increment. That made the
// only staleness signal LensAnalytics exports unusable on a dual-network deployment.
//
// `network` is deliberately the ONLY added label. See docs/ingest-metrics.md:
// series count is `pairs x networks`, which is bounded by configuration.
// Do NOT add `issuer` or a raw pool id here — the cardinality notes in that
// doc explain why those labels do not belong on these metrics.
